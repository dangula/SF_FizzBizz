##FizzBUzz Problem to solve

Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

FizzBuzz is a game has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to weed out non-programmers during job interviews. 
The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops. 
The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100:

* For multiples of three print Fizz instead of that number
* For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of that number
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of that number
* Else print that number

Some sample solutions to Fizzbuzz is provided to provoke discussion.
1. FizzBuzz
2. Fizzbuzz1
3. Fizzbuzz2
4. Fizzbuzz3
5. Fizzbuzz4
6. Fizzbuzz5
7. Fizzbuzz6

You will be assigned with one or two team members for discussion:

* If you were to implement the FizzBuzz kata, which of these implementations would your code end up most similar to?
* If you were to implement the FizzBuzz kata using TDD, which of these implementations would your code end up most similar to?

You will be given 10 mins, once you finish 10 mins break-out session join the main session.
